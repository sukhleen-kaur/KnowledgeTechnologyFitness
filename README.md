Sometimes coming up with a good workout plan for the day can be difficult, especially for a beginner. It might be hard to figure out, for instance, which exercises are best for weight loss or which exercises target the core area of the body. This system helps in answering these questions. The system gives out a day workout plan for the user. The workout plan is based on the answers provided by the user on the questions presented by the system. This system can be used by anyone who would be interested in getting assistance on which exercises they could do during their workout session. This system serves more as an indication to what type of exercises to incorporate or perform in your workout rather than give the users a detailed plan.
